##my approch:
1. clearly we need to take 2 inputs that is n and string s .
2. then , as we need to know how many matches won by whom , so we declare 2 variables as k_a,k_d to determine scores.
3. then simple logic , if i'th match won by Anton ita A, or D  , as there's no tie.
4. for every A count , k_a increases by 1 , same for k_d.
5. then , just print the output.
