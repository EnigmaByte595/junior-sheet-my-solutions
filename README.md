# junior-sheet-my-solutions
My solutions and explanations for problems from the Junior Sheet (Codeforces), arranged in increasing difficulty.

- Each problem has its own folder.  
- `solution.cpp` contains the code.  
- `README.md` explains the idea, thought process, and notes.

## üìù Explanations
Explanations are in text form, but sometimes I may also upload handwritten notes or diagrams (images) for clarity.

## üôè Credits
The **Junior Sheet** was created and shared publicly by its original author on codeforces blogs you can get it here   https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/79231 
Full credit goes to them for curating the problem list. 

This repository only contains **my own solutions and explanations**.
