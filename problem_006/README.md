## my approach
1.take no of columns input 
2.we need to store the heights of the columns , gonna do it with the help of vector
3.then we need to read all the columns so that we can sort them, will do it with the help of for loop.
4.u can get the idea by thinking a bit that , rearrange and then , will arrange in ascending order as asked.
5.We use if (i < n-1) so that spaces are printed only between numbers, not after the last one, 
because the output format must not have a trailing space.
