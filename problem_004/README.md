## My Approach
1.It is told to take input n first , that is number of problems.
2.Then it said for n lines contain 3 integers either 0 or 1 , here it says about who is sure and who is unsure like , true and false thing.
3. but it is saying they will only write when atleast 2 of them is correct .
4. we can think like that , when only theres more than 2 , 1's .
5. so , we can get it by sum , sum >= 3.
6. whenever , sum >= 2 , question count+1, and here we got answer.
