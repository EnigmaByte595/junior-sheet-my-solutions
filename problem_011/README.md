## my approach
initializing game variables.
left starts with 0 , pointing to the first card in the vector . and right one - last one.
turn counter help us figure out whose turn it is.
while loop runs till cards are there left to pick.
then compare card on the left to the right , and increment , decrement.
if turn is even, added to sereja , odd then dima.
and print scores.
