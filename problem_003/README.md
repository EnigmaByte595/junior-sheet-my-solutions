#my approach
1. clearly we can see we need to take 2 inputs of weight of 2 brothers
2. then , by simple mathematics , when after years a > b , we need to print it .
3. so , when a < = b , we can apply while loop to get , years one after another till , limak's weight gets more.
4. like , everytime loop will apply for every a < = b , and when finally a > b , it will close and , here we get our answer.
